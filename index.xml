      <description>SUPPORT 
The Statistics and Data Analysis Unit of the HRB CRF-C supports local, patient-focused researchers in the areas of study design and data analysis. We operate under a collaborative model of support and work closely with investigators. Most of our collaborations can be classified as follows:
Collaboration on new projects – Our primary means of working with investigators is on projects where SDAU staff will have a substantial influence on the design, conduct, analysis, and reporting of the research.</description>

      <description>I was greeted today with the news that there are 5, not 2, types of diabetes. This is earth-shattering if you are a diabetologist or diabetes researcher. However, I soon as I saw the term “data-driven clustering” I knew I could probably relax.
For the uninitiated, data-driven clustering techniques can seem magical. The basic premise is that you take a sample, measure lots of things about them, and then feed all those data into an algorithm that will divide your sample into mutually exclusive groups.</description>
