						<p><strong>Open Science @ UCC</strong> is a 3 day workshop running from October 31 to November 2 (2018) at <a href="https://www.ucc.ie/">University College Cork</a>.</p>

<p>Open science practices help make research accessible, transparent, and replicable. While research funders now require the use of various open science practices, too few researchers know how.</p>

<p>The goal of <strong>Open Science @ UCC</strong> is to bring accomplished experts in open science to <a href="https://www.irishexaminer.com/examviral/cork-voted-third-friendliest-city-in-the-world-861952.html">Cork</a> to train 30 Open Science Champions. The event will be a mixture of lectures, hands-on tutorials, and participant-driven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">un-conferencing</a>. There will also be time for discussions, break-out groups, and socializing. Participants will thus leave the workshop as skilled, confident advocates for open science, connected to a network of other open science experts.</p>

<p><strong>Open Science @ UCC</strong> will take place in a multi-purpose learning space called the Creative Zone, located in the main Library on the UCC campus. The topics and confirmed speakers are listed below. We welcome researchers from all stages of their careers.</p>

<p><img src="https://crfcsdau.github.io/images/campus.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To register for the event, please email Dr Darren Dahly (ddahly@ucc.ie). The registration fee is 300 euros per participant for the full three-day event. Payments can be made by invoice or credit card (links for payment will be provided upon registration).</p>

					</header>
					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>Welcome to the world of clinical trials. You&rsquo;ve got a great idea that has real potential to improve health. But I have some bad news for you. Are you ready?</p>

<p>Your intervention won&rsquo;t work. I’m sorry. It won’t. Not even a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But hold on a minute,&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;I haven’t even run the trial yet. How can you possibly know it won’t work?&rdquo; Experience my friend – and as any experienced trialist can tell you, the intervention never works. (Ok, sometimes the intervention works, but it usually doesn&rsquo;t, even though we almost always think it will.)</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>With that in mind, let’s go forward in time. The last follow-up was completed a few weeks ago. Now you are standing next to me, the trial statistician, at the front of a large meeting room in some cookie-cutter hotel. I have a clicker in my hand, there is a graph projected onto the large screen behind us, and I just told everyone that the intervention didn’t work.</p>

<p>Who is everyone? The entire study team of course, all sat quietly at a giant U-shaped table with little name placards in front of them. All the site investigators are there. There is someone from the DMSB too. And of course all the other people it takes to run a trial. Someone from the funding body is there as well - it seems they are interested in what you did with their money. And don’t forget the patients’ representative – they gave more than anyone.</p>

<p>Look at their faces. They look so confused. Disappointed. A few even look sad. Oh no, are those tears? And we were having so much fun up to this point, drinking free coffee and catching up since our last meeting. Now they are just blankly staring at us. You have to say something. You have to say something now.</p>

<p><strong>Freeze time</strong></p>

<p>What are you going to say?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re new to this, so let me help you. To survive this moment, you need to be able to look everyone in the eye and remind them that the trial was designed to <strong>rigorously answer an important question</strong>. If this is true, then you have likely just learned something useful, regardless of whether the intervention worked or not. Further, if the study was well designed, other people will be more likely to trust your result and act on it. In other words, there is no such thing as a “negative” trial result – the answer given by a well-designed trial is always useful, whether the intervention worked or not. So you simply remind everyone of this. People will still be disappointed of course - we’d be fools to test treatments if we didn’t think they worked, and it&rsquo;s natural to hope. But at least we know we ran a good trial and added knowledge to the world - that&rsquo;s not nothing.</p>

<p>And what if the trial wasn’t well designed? Then the errors in the design might be used to reasonably explain away any result, &ldquo;positive&rdquo; or &ldquo;negative&rdquo;. Maybe the intervention didn&rsquo;t appear to work because the trial was too small. Or maybe it only appeared to work because you used a surrogate outcome. And regardless of the explanations you come up with, nobody else will believe the result anyway, so what&rsquo;s the point? So the best case scenario is that you’ve wasted lots of time and money. The worst case scenario is that you have needlessly put patients at risk. Trust me, there&rsquo;s not enough perfume in France to cover that kind of stink.</p>

<p>So here is my advice. At the start of any trial, imagine yourself in the situation above. The intervention didn’t work. How are you going to live with yourself? Now act accordingly.</p>

					</header>
					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>Thanks again to everyone who came to Week 2 of the Open Science Challenge. If you haven’t made it yet, no worries, you are welcome to join us any time (but if you want me to stop emailing you, let me know).</p>

<p>Our next meeting will be Friday, May 18 at 2-3 pm in WGB room 4.05, where we will have a visit from <a href="https://twitter.com/vickyhellon">Vicky Hellon</a> from <a href="https://f1000.com/">F1000</a> to talk about <a href="https://hrbopenresearch.org/">HRB Open Research</a>.</p>

<p>At our last meeting, we had an excellent discussion of what makes for a good research question. I think the key points from our conversation were as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>The questions must be scientific, but exactly does this mean? I offered a bit on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction">Problem of Induction, Popper, and Falsification</a>, largely just to establish that smart people can and do disagree on what science is and how it progresses. However, we all seemed to generally agree that science is about asking questions that can be addressed by empirical data.</li>
<li>We discussed the idea of novelty, contrasting false bravado and exaggeration with genuine novelty that drives scientific progress. We also discussed the relative merits of novelty and the importance of replication.</li>
<li>We talked about the importance of our research questions. I mentioned concerns that many research questions, at least in biomedical science, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62229-1/fulltext">aren’t the ones that stakeholders and decision makers want answered</a>. I also mentioned the role of initiatives like the <a href="http://www.jla.nihr.ac.uk/about-the-james-lind-alliance/about-psps.htm">JLA Priority Setting Partnerships</a>, as well as funding bodies, in focusing our collective efforts on important questions. We also discussed impact and how the REF in the UK has affected wider perceptions of this term – and thankfully we all agreed that seeing your research in the media isn’t necessarily impact. This conversation dovetailed into shared concerns that basic and methodological research were wrongly placed at disadvantage as the potential value wasn’t as immediately apparent as say an assessment of an intervention – and so we highlighted the need to make the case for the importance of this research, rather than to assume others (reviewers/editors) understand.</li>
<li>We discussed ethics, which turned more towards a discussion of ethics around data collection (rather than scientific questions), so we agreed to pick up this topic again.</li>
<li>We also we able to identify cultural differences across the various fields we each represent.</li>
</ol>

<p>In light of this conversation, we should now be more prepared to devise our own research questions, which we can discuss further on a newly established <a href="https://opensciencechallenge.slack.com/">Slack channel</a>.</p>

					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>Thank you to everyone who came to our first session of the HRB Open Science Challenge. If you weren’t able to make it, no problem – we’ll catch you at the next session on May 4th, in room 4.05 of the Western Gateway Building (10:30 to 11:30), when we’ll be discussing what makes a good research question. Please give some thought to that before we meet, as well as what data you might/will use for your project.</p>

<p>During the first meeting we discussed motivations for open science.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Open Access - Since much of science is publicly funded, it seems reasonable that the public should be able to access the results of said research.</p></li>

<li><p>Reproducibility/Replicability – Single experiments in isolation provide little assurance that an observed effect is “real”. Science thus relies on scientists repeating and then confirming/dis-confirming earlier studies to eventually arrive at a consensus. Sharing research methods and materials is needed to facilitate this process.</p></li>

<li><p>Research Integrity – There is plenty of evidence to suggest that many studies are not conducted properly, especially when it comes to analyses of the resulting data. Mistakes tend to go un-detected because we typically work in isolation and don’t usually fully document our analyses. Further, we can’t really count on peer review to catch mistakes, since we don’t typically share materials with editors/reviewers, and their ability to judge science is highly variable. Thus, the best way (at least in my opinion) to improve the quality of data analyses is to ensure that they are done in a transparent, reproducible manner, which will be a substantial focus of these workshops.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly we touched on the various tools we’ll cover during the challenge. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Statistical programming/scripting</li>
<li>Reproducible reports/literate programming</li>
<li>Software testing</li>
<li>Pre-registration</li>
<li>Registered reports</li>
<li>Pre-prints</li>
<li>Open science publishing platforms</li>
</ul>

						<p>I’m a big fan of open science, and regularly argue for its importance. Strangely, however, I’ve never actually used many of the available open science tools. It&rsquo;s just too damn easy to keep going with the status quo. That stops today!</p>

<p>Starting on Friday, April 20, <a href="https://twitter.com/B_A_Palmer">Brendan</a> and I will be hosting the HRB CRFC Open Science challenge. The challenge will be open until the end of the year, during which we will meet 2 or 3 times per month to develop an open science research project. To complete the challenge, participants must meet the following goals before the end of the year:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a project on the <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://cos.io/prereg/">Pre-register</a> the analysis.</li>
<li>Prepare all the analysis code so that it can be shared.<br /></li>
<li>Prepare the data according to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">FAIR principles</a>.</li>
<li>Write up the manuscript.</li>
<li>Submit a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">pre-print</a> to the relevant repository</li>
<li>Submit the manuscript to the <a href="https://hrbopenresearch.org/">HRB Open Resaerch Publishing Platform</a> for publication.</li>
</ol>

<p>During the workshops, we will introduce and discuss the various open science tools, as well as talk about how to develop a manuscript in a manner that <a href="https://darrendahly.github.io/post/2017-03-21-prereg/">faciliates pre-registration</a>.</p>

<p>To sign up, please email me your name, position, and affiliation (ddahly@ucc.ie). Anyone is welcome, but a large proportion of places will be reserved for PhD Students and Postdoctoral Researchers working at UCC. Ideally, participants will have some ideas about their research question, and already have access to relevant data. Workshops will rely substantially on small-group discussions - you have been warned.</p>

<p>Meetings will generally take place on Friday mornings in the Western Gateway Building on the UCC campus. The specific schedule will be announced for each month as the rooms are sorted.</p>
