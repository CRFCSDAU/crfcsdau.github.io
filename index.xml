      <description>SUPPORT 
The Statistics and Data Analysis Unit of the HRB CRF-C supports local, patient-focused researchers in the areas of study design and data analysis. We operate under a collaborative model of support and work closely with investigators. Most of our collaborations can be classified as follows:
Collaboration on new projects – Our primary means of working with investigators is on projects where SDAU staff will have a substantial influence on the design, conduct, analysis, and reporting of the research.</description>

      <title>Open Science @ UCC</title>

      <description>The goal of Open Science @ UCC (Oct 31 to Nov 2, 2018) is to motivate and train 30 open science champions, who will work to support open science in their local research environments.
The event will be a mixture of lectures, tutorials, and participant-driven un-conferencing. There will also be plenty of time for small-group discussion and other socializing. Participants will thus leave the workshop as skilled, confident advocates for open science, connected to a network of other open science experts.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the world of clinical trials. You&amp;rsquo;ve got a great idea that has real potential to improve health. But I have some bad news for you. Are you ready?
Your intervention won&amp;rsquo;t work. I’m sorry. It won’t. Not even a little.
&amp;ldquo;But hold on a minute,&amp;rdquo; you say. &amp;ldquo;I haven’t even run the trial yet. How can you possibly know it won’t work?&amp;rdquo; Experience my friend – and as any experienced trialist can tell you, the intervention never works.</description>

      <description>Thanks again to everyone who came to Week 2 of the Open Science Challenge. If you haven’t made it yet, no worries, you are welcome to join us any time (but if you want me to stop emailing you, let me know).
Our next meeting will be Friday, May 18 at 2-3 pm in WGB room 4.05, where we will have a visit from Vicky Hellon from F1000 to talk about HRB Open Research.</description>

      <description>Thank you to everyone who came to our first session of the HRB Open Science Challenge. If you weren’t able to make it, no problem – we’ll catch you at the next session on May 4th, in room 4.05 of the Western Gateway Building (10:30 to 11:30), when we’ll be discussing what makes a good research question. Please give some thought to that before we meet, as well as what data you might/will use for your project.</description>

      <description>I’m a big fan of open science, and regularly argue for its importance. Strangely, however, I’ve never actually used many of the available open science tools. It&amp;rsquo;s just too damn easy to keep going with the status quo. That stops today!
Starting on Friday, April 20, Brendan and I will be hosting the HRB CRFC Open Science challenge. The challenge will be open until the end of the year, during which we will meet 2 or 3 times per month to develop an open science research project.</description>

      <title>Magical clusters</title>

      <description>I was greeted today with the news that there are 5, not 2, types of diabetes. This is earth-shattering if you are a diabetologist or diabetes researcher. However, I soon as I saw the term “data-driven clustering” I knew I could probably relax.
For the uninitiated, data-driven clustering techniques can seem magical. The basic premise is that you take a sample, measure lots of things about them, and then feed all those data into an algorithm that will divide your sample into mutually exclusive groups.</description>
