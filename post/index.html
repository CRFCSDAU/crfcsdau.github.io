					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>Welcome to the world of clinical trials. I think it’s great that you want to find new treatments that will improve human health. And let’s be honest, if you are a clinician, the career boost is nice as well. But I have some bad news for you. Are you ready?</p>

<p>Your intervention doesn’t work. I’m sorry. It doesn’t. Not even a little. No, not in the older patients. Not in the younger ones either. It…does…not…work.</p>

<p>Hold on a minute. You haven’t even run the trial yet. So how can I possibly know it doesn’t work? Experience my friend – and as any experienced trialist can tell you, the intervention never works. Ever. I don’t care about your pilot data. I don’t care about your theory or proposed mechanism. If I could find a way to short clinical trials like stock, I’d be filthy rich. So I’ll say it one last time: The intervention never works.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Ok, with that in mind, let’s go forward in time, to the end of the trial. You are standing next to me (the trial’s statistician) at the front of a large meeting room in an almost-really-nice-hotel. I have a clicker in my hand, there is a graph projected onto the large screen behind us, and I just told everyone that the intervention didn’t work.</p>

<p>Who is everyone? The entire study team of course, all sat quietly at a giant U-shaped table with little name placards in front of them. All the site investigators are there. There is someone from the DMSB too. And of course all the other people that just spent years of their lives working on the trial. Someone from the funding body is there as well - it seems they are interested in what you did with their money. And don’t forget the patients’ representative – they gave more than anyone.</p>

<p>OMG, look at their faces. They look so confused. Disappointed. A few even look sad. Oh no, are those tears? But we were just having so much fun, drinking free coffee and catching up since our last meeting. Now they are just staring at us. You have to say something. You have to say something now.</p>

<p><strong>Freeze time</strong></p>

<p>What are you going to say?</p>

<p>To survive this moment, you need to be able to look everyone in the eye and remind them that the trial was designed to <strong>rigorously answer an important question</strong>. If this is true, then you have likely just learned something useful, regardless of whether the intervention worked or not. Further, if the study was well designed, other people will be more likely to trust your result and act on it. In other words, there is no such thing as a “negative” trial result – the answer given by a well-designed trial is always useful, whether the intervention worked or not. So you simply remind everyone of this. People will still be disappointed of course - we’d be fools to test treatments if we didn’t think they worked (even though they never do). But at least we can all live with ourselves knowing that we gave it our absolute best. At least we all know that we added knowledge to the world.</p>

<p>And what if the trial wasn’t well designed? Then the errors in the design might be used to reasonably explain away any result, &ldquo;positive&rdquo; or &ldquo;negative&rdquo;. Maybe the intervention didn&rsquo;t appear to work because the trial was too small. Or maybe it only appeared to work because you used a surrogate outcome. And regardless of the explanations you come up with, nobody else will believe the result anyway, so what&rsquo;s the point? So the best case scenario is that you’ve wasted lots of time and money. The worst case scenario is that you have needlessly put patients at risk. Trust me, there&rsquo;s not enough perfume in France to cover that kind of stink.</p>

<p>So here is my advice. At the start of any trial, imagine yourself in the situation above. The intervention didn’t work. How are you going to live with yourself? Now act accordingly.</p>

					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>Thanks again to everyone who came to Week 2 of the Open Science Challenge. If you haven’t made it yet, no worries, you are welcome to join us any time (but if you want me to stop emailing you, let me know).</p>

<p>Our next meeting will be Friday, May 18 at 2-3 pm in WGB room 4.05, where we will have a visit from <a href="https://twitter.com/vickyhellon">Vicky Hellon</a> from <a href="https://f1000.com/">F1000</a> to talk about <a href="https://hrbopenresearch.org/">HRB Open Research</a>.</p>

<p>At our last meeting, we had an excellent discussion of what makes for a good research question. I think the key points from our conversation were as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>The questions must be scientific, but exactly does this mean? I offered a bit on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction">Problem of Induction, Popper, and Falsification</a>, largely just to establish that smart people can and do disagree on what science is and how it progresses. However, we all seemed to generally agree that science is about asking questions that can be addressed by empirical data.</li>
<li>We discussed the idea of novelty, contrasting false bravado and exaggeration with genuine novelty that drives scientific progress. We also discussed the relative merits of novelty and the importance of replication.</li>
<li>We talked about the importance of our research questions. I mentioned concerns that many research questions, at least in biomedical science, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62229-1/fulltext">aren’t the ones that stakeholders and decision makers want answered</a>. I also mentioned the role of initiatives like the <a href="http://www.jla.nihr.ac.uk/about-the-james-lind-alliance/about-psps.htm">JLA Priority Setting Partnerships</a>, as well as funding bodies, in focusing our collective efforts on important questions. We also discussed impact and how the REF in the UK has affected wider perceptions of this term – and thankfully we all agreed that seeing your research in the media isn’t necessarily impact. This conversation dovetailed into shared concerns that basic and methodological research were wrongly placed at disadvantage as the potential value wasn’t as immediately apparent as say an assessment of an intervention – and so we highlighted the need to make the case for the importance of this research, rather than to assume others (reviewers/editors) understand.</li>
<li>We discussed ethics, which turned more towards a discussion of ethics around data collection (rather than scientific questions), so we agreed to pick up this topic again.</li>
<li>We also we able to identify cultural differences across the various fields we each represent.</li>
</ol>

<p>In light of this conversation, we should now be more prepared to devise our own research questions, which we can discuss further on a newly established <a href="https://opensciencechallenge.slack.com/">Slack channel</a>.</p>

						<p>Thank you to everyone who came to our first session of the HRB Open Science Challenge. If you weren’t able to make it, no problem – we’ll catch you at the next session on May 4th, in room 4.05 of the Western Gateway Building (10:30 to 11:30), when we’ll be discussing what makes a good research question. Please give some thought to that before we meet, as well as what data you might/will use for your project.</p>

<p>During the first meeting we discussed motivations for open science.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Open Access - Since much of science is publicly funded, it seems reasonable that the public should be able to access the results of said research.</p></li>

<li><p>Reproducibility/Replicability – Single experiments in isolation provide little assurance that an observed effect is “real”. Science thus relies on scientists repeating and then confirming/dis-confirming earlier studies to eventually arrive at a consensus. Sharing research methods and materials is needed to facilitate this process.</p></li>

<li><p>Research Integrity – There is plenty of evidence to suggest that many studies are not conducted properly, especially when it comes to analyses of the resulting data. Mistakes tend to go un-detected because we typically work in isolation and don’t usually fully document our analyses. Further, we can’t really count on peer review to catch mistakes, since we don’t typically share materials with editors/reviewers, and their ability to judge science is highly variable. Thus, the best way (at least in my opinion) to improve the quality of data analyses is to ensure that they are done in a transparent, reproducible manner, which will be a substantial focus of these workshops.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly we touched on the various tools we’ll cover during the challenge. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Statistical programming/scripting</li>
<li>Reproducible reports/literate programming</li>
<li>Software testing</li>
<li>Pre-registration</li>
<li>Registered reports</li>
<li>Pre-prints</li>
<li>Open science publishing platforms</li>
</ul>

						<p>I’m a big fan of open science, and regularly argue for its importance. Strangely, however, I’ve never actually used many of the available open science tools. It&rsquo;s just too damn easy to keep going with the status quo. That stops today!</p>

<p>Starting on Friday, April 20, <a href="https://twitter.com/B_A_Palmer">Brendan</a> and I will be hosting the HRB CRFC Open Science challenge. The challenge will be open until the end of the year, during which we will meet 2 or 3 times per month to develop an open science research project. To complete the challenge, participants must meet the following goals before the end of the year:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a project on the <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://cos.io/prereg/">Pre-register</a> the analysis.</li>
<li>Prepare all the analysis code so that it can be shared.<br /></li>
<li>Prepare the data according to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">FAIR principles</a>.</li>
<li>Write up the manuscript.</li>
<li>Submit a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">pre-print</a> to the relevant repository</li>
<li>Submit the manuscript to the <a href="https://hrbopenresearch.org/">HRB Open Resaerch Publishing Platform</a> for publication.</li>
</ol>

<p>During the workshops, we will introduce and discuss the various open science tools, as well as talk about how to develop a manuscript in a manner that <a href="https://darrendahly.github.io/post/2017-03-21-prereg/">faciliates pre-registration</a>.</p>

<p>To sign up, please email me your name, position, and affiliation (ddahly@ucc.ie). Anyone is welcome, but a large proportion of places will be reserved for PhD Students and Postdoctoral Researchers working at UCC. Ideally, participants will have some ideas about their research question, and already have access to relevant data. Workshops will rely substantially on small-group discussions - you have been warned.</p>

<p>Meetings will generally take place on Friday mornings in the Western Gateway Building on the UCC campus. The specific schedule will be announced for each month as the rooms are sorted.</p>

					</header>
					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>I was greeted today with <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/health-43246261">the news that there are 5, not 2, types of diabetes</a>. This is <strong>earth-shattering</strong> if you are a diabetologist or diabetes researcher. However, I soon as I saw the term “data-driven clustering” I knew I could probably relax.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, data-driven clustering techniques can seem magical. The basic premise is that you take a sample, measure lots of things about them, and then feed all those data into an algorithm that will divide your sample into mutually exclusive groups. Then, hopefully, knowing what group a person is in will tell you something about them that isn’t otherwise apparent in the data. This is a seductive idea. In this diabetes example, the authors are touting that knowing a patient’s group will eventually be used to guide their treatment.</p>
<p>I suspect that some people reading about this research won’t understand just how easy it is to detect groups. It’s so easy in fact that I would be shocked if groups <em>weren’t</em> found in most cases. This is because clustering, regardless of the specific method used, is just another way to describe relationships among variables - and as long as the variables are in fact related, you will find groups. Here is a simple example:</p>
<p>First, create some data for two variables. The first is just 1000 observations drawn from a standard normal. The second variable then multiplies the first variable by 2 and adds some additional randomly distributed noise.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  x &lt;- rnorm(1000, 0, 1)
  y &lt;- (2 * x) + rnorm(1000, 0, 3)

  data &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)</code></pre>
<p>Plotting these data confirms that they are related.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>    plot(x, y, data = data)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/cluster_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.svg" width="576" /></p>
<p>Pretending that we didn’t just simulate these data, upon seeing them for the first time, most people would probably try to fit a regression line, the results of which are below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  library(pander)

  pander(lm(y ~ x, data))</code></pre>
<table style="width:88%;">
<caption>Fitting linear model: y ~ x</caption>
<colgroup>
<col width="25%" />
<col width="15%" />
<col width="18%" />
<col width="13%" />
<col width="15%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center"> </th>
<th align="center">Estimate</th>
<th align="center">Std. Error</th>
<th align="center">t value</th>
<th align="center">Pr(&gt;|t|)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><strong>(Intercept)</strong></td>
<td align="center">0.07992</td>
<td align="center">0.09135</td>
<td align="center">0.8749</td>
<td align="center">0.3818</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center"><strong>x</strong></td>
<td align="center">2.023</td>
<td align="center">0.08921</td>
<td align="center">22.68</td>
<td align="center">3.411e-92</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So the results of the linear model confirm what we already know. However, there are other ways to explain the data, so to speak. Here are the results from a fairly constrained finite mixture model which is similar enough to the k-means approach used in the diabetes paper.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  library(mclust)

  bic &lt;- mclustBIC(data)

  clusters &lt;- Mclust(data, x = bic, modelNames = (&quot;EII&quot;))
  
# summary(clusters, parameters = TRUE)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>  plot(clusters, what = &quot;classification&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/cluster_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.svg" width="576" /></p>
<p>What you can see from the plot is that the clustering algorithm explained the x-y scatter plot by positing the existence of 8 groups of observations, each covering a different area in the overall space. In other words, the clustering algorithm is trying to describe 2 correlated variables when the only tool it has is to group people. As long as there is in fact a correlation between the two variables, then you are going to need more than one group to describe the data (unless you start to use more flexible models).</p>
<p>So in most cases it is trivially easy to find groups. The challenge is of course to ascribe meaning to them. If we return to the linear regression, we might want to infer that x is a cause of y based on the observed relationship. However, we’d be foolish to do so without other information to support the causal claim. Similarly, you can pretend that data-driven clusters are revealing some deeper truth, but again, without other corroborating information, I wouldn’t be making strong claims.</p>
<p>For additional thoughts, <a href="https://twitter.com/f2harrell">Frank Harrell</a> also blogged about this <a href="http://www.fharrell.com/post/errmed/#cluster">here</a>; and <a href="https://twitter.com/MaartenvSmeden">Maarten van Smeden</a> did some other simulation work described <a href="https://twitter.com/MaartenvSmeden/status/970237614413570048">here</a>.</p>
